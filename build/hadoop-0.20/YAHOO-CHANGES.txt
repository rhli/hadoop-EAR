yahoo-hadoop-0.20.0.2902658004:

    MAPREDUCE-809 Fix job-summary logs to correctly record final status of 
    FAILED and KILLED jobs.  
    http://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12414726/MAPREDUCE-809_0_20090728_yhadoop20.patch 

    MAPREDUCE-740 Log a job-summary at the end of a job, while
    allowing it to be configured to use a custom appender if desired.
    http://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12413941/MAPREDUCE-740_2_20090717_yhadoop20.patch

    MAPREDUCE-771 Fixes a bug which delays normal jobs in favor of
    high-ram jobs.
    http://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12413990/MAPREDUCE-771-20.patch

    HADOOP-5420 Support setsid based kill in LinuxTaskController.
    http://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12414735/5420-ydist.patch.txt

    MAPREDUCE-733 Fixes a bug that when a task tracker is killed ,
    it throws exception. Instead it should catch it and process it and
    allow the rest of the flow to go through
    http://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12413015/MAPREDUCE-733-ydist.patch

    MAPREDUCE-734 Fixes a bug which prevented hi ram jobs from being
    removed from the scheduler queue.
    http://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12413035/MAPREDUCE-734-20.patch

    MAPREDUCE-693  Fixes a bug that when a job is submitted and the
    JT is restarted (before job files have been written) and the job
    is killed after recovery, the conf files fail to be moved to the
    "done" subdirectory.
    http://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12412823/MAPREDUCE-693-v1.2-branch-0.20.patch

    MAPREDUCE-722 Fixes a bug where more slots are getting reserved

    http://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12412744/MAPREDUCE-722.1.txt

    MAPREDUCE-683 TestJobTrackerRestart failed because of stale
    filemanager cache (which was created once per jvm). This patch makes
    sure that the filemanager is inited upon every JobHistory.init()
    and hence upon every restart. Note that this wont happen in production
    as upon a restart the new jobtracker will start in a new jvm and
    hence a new cache will be created.
    http://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12412743/MAPREDUCE-683-v1.2.1-branch-0.20.patch

    MAPREDUCE-709 Fixes a bug where node health check script does

    limit the number of slots that can be concurrently used per queue
    at any given time.
    http://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12412592/MAPREDUCE-532-20.patch

    MAPREDUCE-211 Provides ability to run a health check script on
    the tasktracker nodes and blacklist nodes if they are unhealthy.
    Contributed by Sreekanth Ramakrishnan.
    http://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12412161/mapred-211-internal.patch

    MAPREDUCE-516 Remove .orig file included by mistake.

    MAPREDUCE-416 Moves the history file to a "done" folder whenever
    a job completes.
    http://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12411938/MAPREDUCE-416-v1.6-branch-0.20.patch

    HADOOP-5980 Previously, task spawned off by LinuxTaskController
    didn't get LD_LIBRARY_PATH in their environment. The tasks will now
    get same LD_LIBRARY_PATH value as when spawned off by
    DefaultTaskController.
    http://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12410825/hadoop-5980-v20.patch

    HADOOP-5981 This issue completes the feature mentioned in
    HADOOP-2838. HADOOP-2838 provided a way to set env variables in
    child process. This issue provides a way to inherit tt's env variables
    and append or reset it. So now X=$X:y will inherit X (if there) and
    append y to it.
    http://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12410454/hadoop5981-branch-20-example.patch

    HADOOP-5419  This issue is to provide an improvement on the
    existing M/R framework to let users know which queues they have
    access to, and for what operations. One use case for this would
    that currently there is no easy way to know if the user has access
    to submit jobs to a queue, until it fails with an access control
    exception.
    http://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12410824/hadoop-5419-v20.2.patch

    HADOOP-5420 Support setsid based kill in LinuxTaskController.
    http://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12414735/5420-ydist.patch.txt

    HADOOP-5643 Added the functionality to refresh jobtrackers node
    list via command line (bin/hadoop mradmin -refreshNodes). The command
    should be run as the jobtracker owner (jobtracker process owner)
    or from a super group (mapred.permissions.supergroup).
    http://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12410619/Fixed%2B5643-0.20-final


    HADOOP-2838 Now the users can set environment variables using
    mapred.child.env. They can do the following X=Y : set X to Y X=$X:Y
    : Append Y to X (which should be taken from the tasktracker)
    http://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12409895/HADOOP-2838-v2.2-branch-20-example.patch
    
    HADOOP-5818. Revert the renaming from FSNamesystem.checkSuperuserPrivilege

    https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12409835/5818for0.20.patch

    HADOOP-5801. Fixes the problem: If the hosts file is changed across restart
    then it should be refreshed upon recovery so that the excluded hosts are
