This is a version of code that runs on Facebook's clusters and is powered by
Apache Hadoop. It is used for both the warehouse workloads and the realtime
HBase/Scribe workloads.

This code is based on Apache Hadoop 0.20/Apache Hadoop 0.20-append.

FB-CHANGES.txt contains the additional pathches that have been committed to
the original code base.
